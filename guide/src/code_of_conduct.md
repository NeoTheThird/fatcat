# Fatcat Code of Conduct

In this early stage of the project, this document is a work in progress. In
particular there is no moderation team or policy for responding to concerns in
online discussions. However, it is important to clarify norms and expectations
as early as possible.

To contact the Internet Archive privately about conduct concerns or to report
unacceptable behavior, you can email <ethics@archive.org>.

## Overview

- We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression,
  sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race,
  ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

- Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that might
  detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

- Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude.

- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
  implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom
  a right answer.

- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you
  want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

- This Code of Conduct applies to all online project spaces (including the
  catalog itself, code repositories, mailing lists, chat rooms, forums, and
  comment threads), as well as any physical spaces such as conference
  gatherings or meetups.

- All participants are expected to respect this code, regardless of their
  position or record of contributions to the project.

## Unacceptable behavior

The following types of behavior are unacceptable in the Fatcat project, both
online and in-person, and constitute code of conduct violations.

### Abusive behavior

- **Harassment:** including offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
  orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion,
  as well as sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
  following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical
  contact, and unwelcome sexual or romantic attention.

- **Threats:** threatening someone physically or verbally. For example,
  threatening to publicize sensitive information about someone’s personal life.

### Unwelcoming behavior

- **Blatant-isms:** saying things that are explicitly racist, sexist,
  homophobic, etc. For example, arguing that some people are less intelligent
  because of their gender, race or religion. Subtle -isms and small mistakes
  made in conversation are not code of conduct violations. However, repeating
  something after it has been pointed out to you that you broke a social rule,
  or antagonizing or arguing with someone who has pointed out your subtle -ism
  is considered unwelcoming behavior, and is not allowed in the project.

- **Maliciousness towards other participants:** deliberately attempting to make
  others feel bad, name-calling, singling out others for derision or exclusion.
  For example, telling someone they’re not a real programmer or that they don’t
  belong in the project.

- **Being especially unpleasant:** for example, if multiple community members
  report annoying, rude, or especially distracting behavior.

- Spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is
  not welcome.
