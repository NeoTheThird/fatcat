Newer ORCID dumps are XML, not JSON. But there is a conversion tool!

    https://github.com/ORCID/orcid-conversion-lib

Commands:

    wget https://github.com/ORCID/orcid-conversion-lib/raw/master/target/orcid-conversion-lib-0.0.2-full.jar
    java -jar orcid-conversion-lib-0.0.2-full.jar OPTIONS

    java -jar orcid-conversion-lib-0.0.2-full.jar --tarball -i ORCID_2019_summaries.tar.gz -v v3_0rc1 -o ORCID_2019_summaries_json.tar.gz

Importing in QA, ran in to some lines like:

    {"response-code":409,"developer-message":"409 Conflict: The ORCID record is locked and cannot be edited. ORCID https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0014-6598","user-message":"The ORCID record is locked.","error-code":9018,"more-info":"https://members.orcid.org/api/resources/troubleshooting"}

Needed to patch to filter those out. Then ran ok like:

    zcat /srv/fatcat/datasets/ORCID_2019_summaries.sample_10k.json.gz | ./fatcat_import.py orcid -
    Counter({'total': 10000, 'exists': 5323, 'insert': 4493, 'skip': 184, 'skip-no-person': 160, 'update': 0})

New dump is about 7.3 million rows, so expecting about 3.2 million new
entities, 250k skips.

Doing bulk run like:

    time zcat /srv/fatcat/datasets/ORCID_2019_summaries.json.gz | parallel -j8 --round-robin --pipe ./fatcat_import.py orcid -

Prod timing:

    Counter({'total': 910643, 'exists': 476812, 'insert': 416583, 'skip': 17248, 'update': 0})
