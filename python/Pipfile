# As of Fall 2020, Internet Archive cluster VMs are split between Ubuntu Xenial
# (16.04) and Focal (20.04). Default python version for xenial is 3.5, but we
# backport python 3.7 and 3.8 using a PPA (deadsnakes). Default on Focal is
# python 3.8, which we hope to stick with for at least a couple years.
